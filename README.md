# TinnAway

## Synopsis

This is the source code for a cross-platform application. The goal of the application is fighting the symptoms and effects if tinnitus. This is achieved with sound generators adding noise at specific frequencies to mask the ringing noise that occurs with tinnitus.

## Installation

You can open this source code as a Visual Studio solution. The solution contains the implemented Android application project and a template for a parallel iOS application project. The Android project was written in Visual Studio 2015 (other versions of Visual Studio may require additional configuration to be run).
As both projects require the Xamarin Visual Studio plugin, the easiest way to get the projects running is to download a fresh version of Visual Studio containing the Xamarin plugin from the Xamarin website: https://www.xamarin.com/platform.

## Running the projects & Contributing

The Android project can be run normally as any other mobile-development Visual Studio project - on an emulator or on a physical mobile device.

Once developed, the iOS project can only be run on a machine running an iOS compiler. This can also be done via a network connecting a Windows/Linux development machine with Visual Studio, connected to a machine running an iOS compiler. This way, the source code can be written on a Windows machine, with testing performed on the iOS machine.
